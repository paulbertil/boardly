-- 0012_session_membership_realtime.sql
-- Live session ROSTER changes, layered on the realtime substrate from 0011. When someone joins
-- or leaves a session, broadcast a nudge on the same private session:<id> channel so co-members'
-- clients reload the roster (live member avatars) and surface a "joined" toast — no refresh.
--
-- Scope: a reusable membership-emit helper + an AFTER INSERT OR DELETE trigger on
-- session_members. NO new authorization: these events ride the session:<id> channel and are
-- gated by 0011's existing realtime.messages receive policy (members only), so the emit is the
-- only piece needed.
--
-- Design (mirrors 0011's KTD-2/3/4):
--   • Server-side emission from a trigger on session_members — fires for every join path
--     (join_session_by_token, the owner-seat trigger) and every leave path (self-leave, owner
--     removal, account-deletion cascade), independent of which client caused it.
--   • Payload carries only the affected user_id. This is NOT a leak: session membership is
--     already mutually visible to members via the roster (session_members + profiles), and the
--     receive policy delivers only to members. The client uses it (and a roster diff) to label
--     the toast; it never trusts it as authorization.
--   • Liveness-gated: only nudge a session that is still live. This also means a hard-delete
--     CASCADE that removes a session's members (e.g. the session row deleted, or account
--     deletion removing the owner) does NOT emit a member-left storm — the parent session is
--     already gone / not-live when the child DELETE trigger fires, so the guard is false.
--   • Soft-delete / expiry (the app's normal "end session") leaves session_members intact, so
--     ending a session emits nothing — correct, nobody actually left.

-- Manual step: apply to the Supabase project. No new Realtime Authorization needed — these
-- events reuse 0011's session:<id> receive policy. Verify: a co-member sees the roster update
-- (and a "joined" toast) when someone joins, and the avatars shrink when someone leaves — all
-- without a manual refresh. See docs/plans/2026-07-13-002-feat-web-session-realtime-plan.md.

-- 0017_social_graph.sql
-- Friends / follow feed (the social arc's next phase): a persistent, ASYMMETRIC follow
-- graph and an activity feed of friends' sends. This deliberately adds a new sharing axis
-- alongside — not replacing — the membership-based sharing of collaborative lists (0003):
-- lists/sessions are unchanged; following is a durable relationship independent of any list.
--
-- Scope (this migration = storage + columns + helpers + trigger + RLS only; every RPC —
-- request_follow, block_user, search_profiles, the feed/profile-sends projection core —
-- lives in 0018, mirroring the 0003→0004 storage-then-RPC split):
--   • profiles gains is_private (public/private account) + privacy_choice_at (the
--     explicit-choice marker, so existing users get exactly one privacy notice — KTD9).
--   • ascents gains first_sent_at: a SERVER-STAMPED, immutable-once-set timestamp of when
--     the server first saw a row as sent=true. It is the feed's sort key — fresh on late
--     sync, unmoved by edits, ungameable by the client's `date` (KTD3).
--   • follows: the edge table (follower → followee, pending|active). No friend symmetry.
--   • blocks: a bidirectional cut. is_blocked(a,b) is threaded through every social read
--     in 0018; blocking removes edges both ways (block_user, 0018).
--   • notifications: fire-and-forget events (new follower, request accepted). Follow
--     REQUESTS are NOT here — they are read from `follows WHERE status='pending'` (KTD7).
--
-- Design (see docs/plans/2026-07-20-001-feat-web-friends-feed-plan.md):
--   • Cross-user reads of owner-only `ascents` (0002) are NOT done by relaxing ascents RLS
--     — that would leak the whole logbook row. They go through 0018's minimal-projection
--     SECURITY DEFINER core. `ascents` RLS stays owner-only, untouched.
--   • Edge creation is gated: `follows` has NO direct INSERT policy (a private target must
--     land `pending`, which the client cannot be trusted to set). request_follow() (0018)
--     is the only writer, same as list_members / join_list_by_token (0003/0004).
--
-- RLS: a user reads their own edges (either side), their own blocks, their own
-- notifications. All FKs are ON DELETE CASCADE on BOTH sides, so the existing
-- public.delete_user() (0001) sweeps a deleted user's follows (both directions), blocks,
-- and notifications with no RPC change.
--
-- NOTE on statement order: the `language sql` helpers validate their bodies at CREATE time
-- (check_function_bodies), so the tables they query must exist first. And the first_sent_at
-- BACKFILL must run BEFORE its trigger exists (the trigger would otherwise overwrite the
-- backfilled value with now()). Hence: profile/ascent columns → backfill → trigger →
-- tables → helpers → RLS.

-- profiles: privacy flag + explicit-choice marker.
--   • is_private DEFAULT false keeps the column non-null and the feed live by default, but
--     the UI never sets it implicitly — new users pick during onboarding, existing users
--     via a one-time notice (KTD9). privacy_choice_at is that marker: NULL = "never chose"
--     (show the notice); a timestamp = "chose" (never show again).

-- Server-stamped the first time a row is seen sent=true, NEVER moved thereafter, NULL while

--   fresh (a week-late sync appears at arrival time), no edit-spam (a re-grade bumps
--   updated_at, not this), no clock-gaming (server clock, not user-set `date`), no
--   backfill-invisibility (ordered by arrival, not climb date).

-- Backfill existing sent rows to a stable, sensible arrival stamp (updated_at). This MUST
-- precede the trigger below — with the trigger present, this UPDATE would re-stamp every
-- row to now(). We also suspend the 0002 updated_at trigger for the backfill so historical
-- rows don't all bump to now() (which would trigger a one-time full re-pull on every synced
-- device). first_sent_at is a fresh column; nothing has stamped it yet.

-- The stamp function. Server-authoritative: it derives first_sent_at from OLD/now() only and
-- OVERWRITES whatever the client sent on EVERY branch (mirrors set_updated_at, 0002). The
-- single assignment `coalesce(OLD.first_sent_at, case when NEW.sent then now() end)` means:
--   • INSERT sent   → coalesce(NULL, now())  = now()   (stamp arrival)
--   • INSERT unsent → coalesce(NULL, NULL)   = NULL     (client value discarded)
--   • UPDATE edit   → coalesce(OLD, ...)      = OLD      (never moves once set)
--   • UPDATE →unsent→ coalesce(OLD, NULL)     = OLD      (never moves once set)
--   • UPDATE →sent  → coalesce(NULL, now())   = now()    (false→true stamps arrival)
-- Crucially the client's NEW.first_sent_at is NEVER read, so a crafted client cannot insert
-- an unsent row with a future first_sent_at and have it survive the later sent-flip (which the
-- earlier `if NEW.sent`-only form allowed — it would pin a spoofed send atop every feed).
-- Pinned search_path (advisor hardening).

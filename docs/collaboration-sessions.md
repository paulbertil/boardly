# Collaboration Sessions (web)

A **collaboration session** lets a crew of signed-in climbers filter the catalog against
*each other's* logbooks — "a project none of us has sent", "one Alice can coach me up". It is
an ephemeral, join-by-link grouping scoped to **one board**. Everyone keeps their own device
and catalog view; the session only changes what the *filters* can target. Web PWA only (no
iOS in v1).

Backend: [`supabase/migrations/0007_collaboration_sessions.sql`](../supabase/migrations/0007_collaboration_sessions.sql).
Client: [`web/src/sessions/`](../web/src/sessions/) plus the catalog + shell touch-points below.

## Session model

- **`sessions`** — one row per session: `owner_id`, `name` (≤60 chars), `board_layout_id`,
  `invite_token` (unguessable share secret), `expires_at`, soft-delete `deleted`.
- **`session_members`** — composite PK `(session_id, user_id)`; membership is the unit of
  sharing. Joining consents to sharing your sent/tried status for that board; leaving (row
  delete) revokes it.
- **Liveness** = `deleted = false AND expires_at > now()`. The **server is the authority**;
  the client's `expires_at` check is only a soft hint with a skew margin.

## The privacy boundary (load-bearing)

`ascents` RLS stays **owner-only** (migration 0002) — it is never relaxed. Cross-member
reads go through one minimal-projection `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC that projects **status only**:

- `session_member_ascents(p_session_id)` → rows `{ user_id, source_catalog_id, status }` with
  `status ∈ {sent, attempted}`, board-scoped, gated on caller membership **and** liveness.
  **Never** returns comments, dates, tries, grade votes, or stars. It is a **pure read** —
  it does not bump `expires_at`.
  - It `LEFT JOIN`s members to their ascents so **every member yields ≥1 row**: a member with
    no matching ascents emits a single marker row `(user_id, NULL, NULL)`. The result
    therefore carries the full, **server-consistent member set** in one call — the client
    seeds per-member Set-pairs from it, and a just-departed member is simply absent.
  - `unlogged` is inferred client-side by *absence* of a problem from a member's rows.

Because filtering is client-side, a member can effectively see another member's whole
sent/tried list for the board (not only aggregate matches). This is accepted — it's what
climbing partners tell each other out loud (R9).

## The four RPCs

| RPC | Gate | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `join_session_by_token(token)` | token is **live** | The only sanctioned membership INSERT. Seats the caller, bumps `expires_at`, returns the session row **without** `invite_token`. |
| `session_member_ascents(p_session_id)` | member **and** live | The status-only cross-member projection (above). Pure read. |
| `touch_session(p_session_id)` | member **and** live | Bumps `expires_at` for manual refresh + rename. Members can't `UPDATE` `sessions` directly (owner-only), so this is their sanctioned expiry-bump path. |
| `session_invite_token(p_session_id)` | member (**no** liveness check) | Re-fetch the share secret on demand — so the token never enters the client cache/pointer. Membership-only so a still-member can retrieve it even for an ended session; harmless because `join_session_by_token` refuses the ended token. |

RLS: `session_members` has **no member-facing INSERT policy** (joins go only through the RPC);
the creator is seated by an owner-seat trigger. DELETE is self-leave **or** owner-removes-member.

## Expiry & liveness (KTD-6)

`expires_at` is bumped **only on explicit intent** — `create`/`join` inline, and manual
refresh/rename via `touch_session`. The projection RPC never bumps it, and passive foreground
refetches never bump it. That is deliberate: if passive activity kept the clock alive, the 24h
privacy backstop would never fire. Expiry is **per-session** — any member's explicit activity
keeps it alive for everyone; the 24h backstop only fires once *all* members go quiet.

## Client architecture

- **`sessionsStore.ts`** — the active session (lifecycle: create / join / leave /
  removeMember / rename / refresh), the roster, `selfId`, and per-member chip selections
  (`memberStatus`). The active-session pointer and `memberStatus` persist to `localStorage`
  keyed by session id (survive navigation + reload); `invite_token` **never** persists —
  it lives in volatile memory (creator) or is re-fetched via `session_invite_token`.
  `SESSION_COLUMNS` never selects `invite_token`. Identity-switch clear is wired from
  `AuthProvider.onAuthStateChange` (a shared device never inherits another user's session).
- **`memberAscentsStore.ts`** — the projection: per-member `{ sentIds, loggedIds }` Set-pairs,
  seeded from the server-consistent snapshot (marker rows → empty Sets, so a zero-ascent
  member is never dropped from the AND-across predicate). Refetched on active-session change,
  on foreground (`visibilitychange`), and on manual refresh. A **max-age** (5 min) drops the
  cached map — enforced by both a timer and an on-read age check — bounding a departed
  member's residual exposure.
- **`filters.ts`** (`matchesSessionStatus`) — the predicate: **OR within a member's row, AND
  across member rows, empty row = ignore**. When a session is active it replaces the
  single-user status clause (self is member row #1), gated on the projection's single atomic
  readiness flag so the list is never blanked mid-load.
- **UI** — `catalog/MemberStatusRow.tsx` + `FilterControls` (per-member rows in the Filters
  sheet), `catalog/SessionBar.tsx` (in-context bar: rename, members, refresh, Share, Leave;
  Start session when solo), `sessions/ShareSession.tsx` (QR + copy/share of the join link),
  `shell/SessionPill.tsx` (global pill on every non-catalog route, with roster + owner
  remove-member + Leave), `sessions/JoinSession.tsx` (`/session/join/$token` — sign-in →
  consent → join → land in the board catalog).

## Security posture (read before changing)

- **`invite_token` is a bearer capability.** Anyone holding the link/QR can join. v1 revokes
  only by **ending the session** (`deleted = true`, which makes both live-gated RPCs refuse)
  or the **owner removing a member**. Token **rotation** (invalidating a leaked link while
  keeping the session) is a deferred follow-up — removing a member does **not** stop them
  rejoining with the same link.
- **Expiry only bumps on explicit intent**, so an active crew must Leave/end to stop sharing;
  the 24h backstop fires only once everyone stops acting.
- **A departed member's residual exposure on peers is bounded** by the projection max-age
  (peers hold a last-good map until their next pull or the max-age drop).

## v1 / v2 boundary

**v1 (this):** on-demand pull (open / foreground / manual refresh); static roster;
board-scoped; status-only projection.

**Deferred to v2:** realtime cross-member updates and online-now presence; shared "crew
projects" list; friend graph / standing groups; multi-board sessions; iOS; member avatars;
a scheduled hard-delete sweep of expired sessions (v1 makes them inert via the RPC guards);
`invite_token` rotation.

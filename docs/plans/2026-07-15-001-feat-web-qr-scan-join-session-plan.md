# In-App QR Scan to Join Session - Plan

## Goal Capsule

- **Objective:** Let a joiner scan a session QR code from inside the web PWA — camera opens in an in-app overlay, decodes the join URL, and lands them on the existing `/session/join/$token` flow — instead of leaving the app for the phone's camera app.
- **Authority:** This plan's Product Contract; the collab-sessions origin plan (`docs/plans/2026-07-07-002-feat-web-collab-sessions-plan.md`) for the join flow it must not change (its R8/R9 consent and R15 invite behavior stay intact).
- **Execution profile:** Web PWA only (`web/`). No Supabase, iOS, or BLE surface. Standard tier — plan → work → review → PR.
- **Stop conditions:** Stop and surface if the decoder stack fails to run on iOS Safari in practice, if bundle plumbing (WASM self-hosting) fights vite-plugin-pwa in a way the plan's KTDs don't anticipate, or if any change to the join route's consent behavior seems required.

## Product Contract

### Summary

Session sharing already renders a QR of the join URL (`ShareSession`), but the joiner must use their phone's camera app to scan it. This adds an in-app scanner-first launcher: the catalog's single "Start or join" button opens a centered dialog **straight to the camera** — a friend's session QR in frame auto-joins — with "Start your own session" demoted below the viewfinder as the host path. The boards overview offers the same launcher camera-only (no board context to host in). The scanner is a thin camera→token→navigate layer; auth, consent, and joining stay owned by `/session/join/$token`.

### Problem Frame

The joiner is standing at the wall next to the sharer, often already inside the app. Switching to the camera app, scanning, and tapping a browser banner is friction at exactly the moment the feature should feel social and instant — and for an installed PWA the camera-app scan may open the link in browser Safari rather than the installed app.

### Requirements

**Entry & visibility**

- R1. The catalog `StartBar` shows a single "Start or join" button that opens the launcher; it renders only when no session is active (the existing `StartBar`/`ActiveBar` swap gives this for free). The boards overview shows a "Scan to join a session" button (camera-only launcher) that hides while a session is active.
- R2. The launcher's join path is usable while signed out — the join route owns sign-in (token survives via its existing sessionStorage resume). Only the host action ("Start your own session") requires sign-in; it is disabled with a hint when signed out.

**Launcher surface**

- R3. The launcher is a centered dialog (shared `Dialog` primitive) that opens **scanner-first**: the camera viewfinder is the primary content with a framing overlay to aid aiming. When a host action is provided (catalog), an "or" divider + "Start your own session" button sit below the viewfinder. Rear camera (`facingMode: 'environment'`) is the hard default; no torch button, no camera-flip in v1.
- R4. A decoded QR whose URL path matches `/session/join/:token` — **any origin** — closes the dialog and navigates internally to `/session/join/$token`. The scanned origin is never navigated to; only the token is used.
- R5. A decoded QR that is not a session link shows a transient "Not a session code" hint and keeps scanning.
- R6. Camera denied or unavailable is never a dead end: the dialog swaps to a short explanation plus a paste-link input that accepts a join URL (same parser as R4) and navigates, with a retry affordance where the platform allows re-prompting. An invalid or unparseable pasted value shows the same inline "Not a session code" feedback as R5's scan miss, without navigating.

**Join semantics (unchanged)**

- R7. After navigation the existing join flow runs untouched: sign-in gate if needed, consent notice (origin R8/R9), `join_session_by_token` RPC, land in the board catalog. The scanner adds no join logic.

**Performance & lifecycle**

- R8. The QR-decode dependency loads only when the launcher opens (dynamic `import()`); catalog and boards bundles are unaffected. The decoder's WASM is self-hosted, never fetched from a third-party CDN.
- R9. The camera stream is fully torn down on dialog close/unmount (no lingering camera-in-use indicator). Backgrounding the PWA and returning re-acquires the stream rather than freezing on the last frame.

### Scope Boundaries

**Non-goals**

- iOS app: sessions don't exist there yet; a native scanner (`VisionKit`) belongs to whatever plan brings sessions to iOS.
- Scan-to-switch mid-session: the affordance is hidden during an active session. Joining another session via a shared *link* while in one keeps today's behavior (seats you and swaps the active session) — unchanged and unadvertised.
- Torch, camera selection UI, and non-QR barcode formats.
- The camera-app scan path stays supported — the QR still encodes a plain URL.

**Deferred to Follow-Up Work**

- Decode-in-worker: the decoder runs on the main thread inside WASM (tens of ms per frame at a throttled scan rate). If jank shows on old phones, the ponyfill can move into a Web Worker later.

## Planning Contract

### Consolidated Research

- **Local:** `web/src/sessions/ShareSession.tsx` builds the QR of `${origin}/session/join/${token}` (`buildJoinUrl`); `web/src/sessions/JoinSession.tsx` owns the `/session/join/$token` route (sign-in, consent, join, redirect); `web/src/catalog/SessionBar.tsx` swaps `StartBar` (idle) / `ActiveBar` (active); `web/src/shell/MyBoards.tsx` renders `/boards` and currently reads neither auth nor session state. The shared bottom-sheet is `web/src/components/ui/drawer.tsx` (`@base-ui/react` drawer; `FilterSheet.tsx` is a clean consumer to mirror). The app has **no** `React.lazy`/dynamic-`import()` precedent — this feature establishes it (Vite code-splits automatically). Tests mock browser APIs via `Object.defineProperty(navigator, …)` (see `web/src/sessions/ShareSession.test.tsx` clipboard mock) and mock the router per `web/src/sessions/JoinSession.test.tsx`.
- **External (load-bearing, verified 2026-07):** iOS Safari still ships `BarcodeDetector` disabled — a JS/WASM decoder is mandatory. The actively maintained stack is `barcode-detector` (Sec-ant) over `zxing-wasm` (zxing-cpp; both released 2026-07); `@yudiel/react-qr-scanner` v2.6 wraps it for React 19 with `playsInline`, `facingMode` constraints, and mount/unmount camera lifecycle. Costs: ~50 kB gzip JS + ~433 kB brotli WASM, lazy on first decode; WASM defaults to a jsDelivr fetch and must be overridden to self-host (`prepareZXingModule({ overrides: { locateFile } })`). Alternatives ruled out: nimiq `qr-scanner` (16 kB, worker-based, but abandoned since 2022, weaker decoder), `html5-qrcode`/`jsQR` (abandoned), zxing-js (revived but weaker old-Java-port decoder). iOS PWA camera quirks to design for: permission is re-prompted roughly per launch in standalone mode; backgrounding freezes the stream (must re-acquire on `visibilitychange`/`pageshow`); one active camera stream at a time; `playsinline`+`muted`+`autoplay` required on the video element.

### Key Technical Decisions

- KTD-1. **Decoder stack: `@yudiel/react-qr-scanner` (over `barcode-detector`/`zxing-wasm`).** The only option combining a best-in-class, actively-maintained decoder with React 19 support and correct iOS video handling out of the box. It always uses the WASM ponyfill (no flaky native-`BarcodeDetector` branching), so behavior is identical across iOS/Android/desktop. Runner-up if the wrapper disappoints: drop to `barcode-detector` directly with a hand-rolled hook — same engine, ~100 lines of camera plumbing.
- KTD-2. **Self-host the reader WASM.** Import the binary via Vite `?url` from the hoisted transitive `zxing-wasm` copy and point `prepareZXingModule` (re-exported by `@yudiel/react-qr-scanner`) at it. A PWA must not depend on jsDelivr at scan time. Do **not** declare `zxing-wasm` as a direct dependency — `barcode-detector` pins it to an exact version, and a separately-ranged direct pin could double-install and desync glue from binary. Guard the self-hosting instead: verify a single deduped `zxing-wasm` copy (`npm ls zxing-wasm`) and no jsDelivr reference for the reader WASM in the built output.
- KTD-3. **Exclude the WASM from the service-worker precache** (workbox `globIgnores` in `vite.config.ts`). Precaching would add ~1 MiB to every install for a feature most users touch rarely — and scanning is inherently online anyway (the join RPC needs the network). Because workbox precaches the lazy JS chunk regardless, the WASM prep is a **retryable runtime step** (`ensureDecoder()`, awaited by the scanner loader), not a top-level await: a top-level await would put the whole module record into a permanently-errored state on an offline fetch, so no retry could recover it. `ensureDecoder` memoizes success and clears the memo on failure, so an offline open routes to the R6 fallback and a later retry recovers instead of leaving a viewfinder that silently never decodes. Add a workbox `runtimeCaching` CacheFirst route for `*.wasm` so repeat scanner opens don't re-download ~433 kB and stay decodable offline.
- KTD-4. **The scanner is a thin layer: decode → parse → navigate.** No auth, consent, or join logic; `/session/join/$token` owns all of it (preserves origin R8/R9 with zero duplication). The only scanner-owned states are camera states.
- KTD-5. **Lazy boundary = the scanner content module.** The trigger button and dialog shell are eager (tiny); `qrDecoder.ts` (which imports `@yudiel/react-qr-scanner`) loads via a dynamic `import()` when the dialog opens, with a spinner fallback and an error state (offline load failure → same never-a-dead-end paste fallback as R6). First dynamic import in the app; no Vite config needed for the split itself. The load is driven by a manual `import()`-in-state loader keyed per attempt, **not** `React.lazy`: `React.lazy` memoizes a rejected import permanently, so its retry edge is unrecoverable. The manual loader re-runs `import('./qrDecoder')` then `ensureDecoder()` on each attempt, so retry recovers a previously-failed chunk or WASM fetch.
- KTD-7. **Scanner-first with the host action folded into the same dialog.** The launcher opens on the camera because joining is the time-sensitive at-the-wall act; hosting is the rarer role, so it is one demoted button below an "or" divider rather than an equal choice. The camera view and the host action live in one `Dialog` (no nested overlays). Tradeoff accepted: opening the dialog fires the camera-permission prompt for everyone, including a would-be host — mitigated by the always-visible Start button and the paste fallback. `ScanToJoin` takes an optional `onStart`/`starting`/`canStart`; when absent (boards overview) the dialog is camera-only.
- KTD-6. **One shared parser module for join URLs.** `parseJoinUrl` lives beside a relocated `buildJoinUrl` in `web/src/sessions/joinUrl.ts`, so the QR writer and both readers (scanner, paste input) can't drift.

### High-Level Technical Design

Scanner state machine (camera states are the only scanner-owned logic; the visible branch is keyed on `phase`, and only the live camera is gated on the dialog being open, so closing tears the stream down without flashing the fallback):

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> loading : dialog opens (lazy chunk + getUserMedia)
    loading --> scanning : stream acquired
    loading --> fallback : denied / no camera / chunk or WASM load failed
    scanning --> scanning : decoded non-session QR — transient hint
    scanning --> done : decoded /session/join/:token
    scanning --> fallback : camera error mid-scan, or "Enter the link instead"
    fallback --> done : valid URL pasted
    fallback --> loading : retry ("Try camera")
    scanning --> paused : PWA backgrounded
    paused --> loading : foregrounded — re-acquire stream
    done --> [*] : close dialog, navigate to /session/join/$token
    scanning --> [*] : user closes — tear down stream
```

Flow across components: entry button (`StartBar` "Start or join" / `MyBoards` "Scan to join") → `ScanToJoin` dialog (lazy scanner + optional host action) → `parseJoinUrl` → `navigate({ to: '/session/join/$token' })` → existing `JoinSession` route (sign-in → consent → RPC → catalog). The host action, when present, calls the caller's `onStart` (createSession) and closes the dialog.

## Implementation Units

### U1. Join-URL helpers module

- **Goal:** One module owns building and parsing join URLs so the QR writer and both scan/paste readers agree.
- **Requirements:** R4, R6 (parser half); KTD-6.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Files:** `web/src/sessions/joinUrl.ts` (new), `web/src/sessions/joinUrl.test.ts` (new), `web/src/sessions/ShareSession.tsx` (import `buildJoinUrl` from the new module).
- **Approach:** Move `buildJoinUrl` out of `ShareSession.tsx`; add `parseJoinUrl(text: string): string | null` returning the token for any parseable URL whose path matches `/session/join/:token` (origin ignored), `null` otherwise. Tolerate surrounding whitespace and trailing slashes; reject empty tokens.
- **Test scenarios:**
  - Happy: full prod-style URL → token; localhost/preview-origin URL → same token; URL with trailing slash → token; pasted text with surrounding whitespace → token.
  - Edge: bare token string (no URL) → null; `/session/join/` with empty token → null; unrelated URL (same origin, different path) → null; non-URL garbage (Wi-Fi QR payload `WIFI:S:…`) → null.
  - Regression: `buildJoinUrl(t)` round-trips through `parseJoinUrl` → `t`.
- **Verification:** `joinUrl.test.ts` green; `ShareSession.test.tsx` still green after the import move.

### U2. Decoder dependency and build plumbing

- **Goal:** `@yudiel/react-qr-scanner` installed, WASM self-hosted, excluded from the SW precache, and only reachable via a lazy chunk.
- **Requirements:** R8; KTD-1, KTD-2, KTD-3, KTD-5.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Files:** `web/package.json`, `web/vite.config.ts`, `web/src/sessions/qrDecoder.ts` (new — the module that imports the scanner lib, wires `prepareZXingModule` to the `?url`-imported WASM asset, and re-exports the `Scanner` component; this file is the dynamic-import boundary).
- **Approach:** `npm i @yudiel/react-qr-scanner` (only this — `zxing-wasm` stays transitive per KTD-2). In `qrDecoder.ts`, import the reader WASM via `?url` from the hoisted `zxing-wasm` copy, import `prepareZXingModule` from `@yudiel/react-qr-scanner`'s re-export, and expose a retryable `ensureDecoder()` that calls `prepareZXingModule({ overrides: { locateFile }, fireImmediately: true })`, memoizing success and clearing its memo on failure (KTD-3). Default-export the `Scanner`. Add workbox `globIgnores` for `**/*.wasm` plus a `runtimeCaching` CacheFirst route for `*.wasm` in the `VitePWA` config.
- **Execution note:** Mostly packaging/config — prefer build-output smoke verification over unit coverage.
- **Test scenarios:** Test expectation: none — build config; proven by U3's integration and the bundle checks below.
- **Verification:** `npm run build` succeeds; `dist/` shows the scanner lib + WASM in a separate chunk not referenced by the entry bundle; the generated SW precache manifest does not list the `.wasm`; `npm ls zxing-wasm` shows a single deduped copy; no jsDelivr reference for the reader WASM in built output; entry-bundle size unchanged (± a trigger button).

### U3. `ScanToJoin` scanner-first dialog

- **Goal:** The launcher surface: a `Dialog` that opens on the camera + all camera states + paste fallback + an optional demoted host action, ending in a navigate (join) or `onStart` (host).
- **Requirements:** R3, R4, R5, R6, R9; KTD-4, KTD-5, KTD-7.
- **Dependencies:** U1, U2.
- **Files:** `web/src/sessions/ScanToJoin.tsx` (new — exports the `ScanToJoin` dialog plus a `ScanToJoinButton` trigger for the camera-only boards-overview use), `web/src/sessions/ScanToJoin.test.tsx` (new).
- **Approach:** `Dialog` primitive, centered. Body branches on `phase` (`scanning` | `fallback`), not on `open`, so the close animation never flashes the fallback card. A manual `import()`-in-state loader (keyed per `attempt`, **not** `React.lazy` — a rejected import is memoized and can't recover) awaits `import('./qrDecoder')` then `ensureDecoder()`, showing a spinner meanwhile; the loaded `Scanner` renders with `constraints={{ facingMode: 'environment' }}` and the framing finder. On decode: `parseJoinUrl` — token → close dialog, `navigate({ to: '/session/join/$token', params: { token } })`; no token → transient hint (R5), keep scanning. Invalid pasted value → same inline hint, no navigation (R6). Camera error / "Enter the link instead" / lazy-chunk or WASM load failure → the fallback phase: explanation, paste input feeding the same parser, "Try camera" retry (bumps `attempt`). Only the `Scanner` mount is gated on `open`, so closing tears the stream down; on `visibilitychange` hidden pause, on visible re-acquire (iOS PWA freeze quirk). Reset state on close so the next open is scanner-first. When `onStart` is passed (catalog), render an "or" divider + "Start your own session" button below the viewfinder (disabled unless `canStart`; spinner while `starting`); absent (boards overview) the dialog is camera-only.
- **Test scenarios (mock `@/components/ui/dialog` to keep content mounted through close, mock `./qrDecoder` with a fake `Scanner` exposing `onScan`; router mocked per `JoinSession.test.tsx`):**
  - Happy: fake scanner emits a valid join URL → navigate called with the token, dialog closes, **and the fallback card does not flash** while closing.
  - Happy: valid URL pasted in fallback input → same navigate.
  - Edge: fake scanner emits a non-session QR → hint visible, no navigate, scanner still mounted.
  - Edge: invalid text pasted in fallback input → inline hint, no navigate.
  - Error: `qrDecoder` import rejects (simulate offline WASM/chunk failure) → fallback state with paste input, no crash.
  - Error: scanner reports camera error → fallback state.
  - Error: import rejects once, then succeeds on retry → scanner recovers (proves the per-attempt loader; a memoized rejection would fail this).
  - Host action: absent when `onStart` is not passed; present and invokes `onStart` when passed; disabled when `canStart` is false.
- **Verification:** component tests green; manual smoke on a real iPhone (Safari + installed PWA): scan a live session QR from another phone → consent screen; deny camera → paste path works; background/foreground mid-scan → viewfinder recovers.

### U4. Entry points: StartBar launcher and boards overview

- **Goal:** The idle-state affordances that open `ScanToJoin`.
- **Requirements:** R1, R2, KTD-7.
- **Dependencies:** U3.
- **Files:** `web/src/catalog/SessionBar.tsx`, `web/src/catalog/SessionBar.test.tsx`, `web/src/shell/MyBoards.tsx`, `web/src/shell/MyBoards.test.tsx`.
- **Approach:** `StartBar`: a single "Start or join" button opens `<ScanToJoin>` with `onStart` (the existing `createSession` flow, which closes the dialog and opens Share), `starting`, and `canStart={signedIn}` — so joining works signed-out and hosting is gated. The old separate scan icon + "Start session" button are replaced. `MyBoards`: a "Scan to join a session" button (`ScanToJoinButton`, camera-only) near the top; the component imports `useSessions` (from `web/src/sessions/sessionsStore.ts`) to hide it while a session is active — signed-out users still see it (R2).
- **Test scenarios:**
  - StartBar: "Start or join" opens the launcher (scanner surface visible); "Start your own session" inside it triggers `createSession` and opens Share; that host action is disabled when signed out; the "Start or join" button is absent when a session is active (`ActiveBar` swap).
  - MyBoards: affordance visible with no active session (signed in and signed out); hidden while a session is active.
- **Verification:** both test files green; manual check that the boards overview affordance doesn't disturb the zero-boards empty state.

## Verification Contract

| Gate | Command / method | Applies to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typecheck + build | `npm run build` in `web/` (`tsc -b && vite build`) — never `tsc --noEmit` | all units |
| Lint | `npm run lint` in `web/` (oxlint; no Prettier) | all units |
| Unit/component tests | `npx vitest run` in `web/` | U1, U3, U4 |
| Bundle checks | inspect `dist/`: lazy chunk exists, `.wasm` absent from SW precache manifest | U2 |
| Device smoke | real iPhone, Safari tab + installed PWA: scan → join; deny camera → paste path; background/foreground recovery | U3, U4 |

The device smoke is mandatory before PR — jsdom cannot prove `getUserMedia`, WASM loading, or the iOS resume quirk.

## Definition of Done

- All four units land with their tests; every Verification Contract gate passes.
- Scanning a live session QR on a real iPhone from inside the app reaches the unchanged consent screen and joins the session.
- The catalog/boards entry bundles carry no scanner-lib bytes (lazy chunk verified).
- `docs/collaboration-sessions.md` documents the in-app scan join path in the same PR (repo doc discipline).
- No abandoned experiments in the diff; single feature branch `feat/web-qr-scan-join` → squash-merge PR.

# Catalog Data Pipeline

How official MoonBoard problems get from the boardsesh API into **Supabase**, and from there
synced down and cached by each client (iOS, PWA, future Android) — and how to regenerate or add
a board. Pairs with [`../CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) §"Importing official problems".

The catalog is **server-distributed**, not bundled: clients no longer ship the problem JSON.
They download it lazily per board into a local cache and query it locally, so every client stays
in sync instead of drifting on divergent bundles. See migration `supabase/migrations/0006_catalog_problems.sql`.

**Key files:** `scripts/fetch_boardsesh*.py` (fetch) + `scripts/enrich_catalog_methods.py`
(backfill the `method` field onto existing staging JSON without re-fetching) +
`scripts/import_catalog.py` (upload to Supabase), `MoonBoardLED/Catalog/Catalog.swift` (synced disk cache + loading),
`MoonBoardLED/Services/Supabase/CatalogSyncManager.swift` (iOS pull),
`web/src/catalog/catalogSync.ts` (PWA pull), `MoonBoardLED/Board/HoldSetMembership.swift`.

```

Two directories, two roles:
- **`catalog-data/`** — staging output of the fetch scripts for all boards/angles. The input to
  `import_catalog.py`.
- **`MoonBoardLED/Resources/`** — **no longer holds catalogs** (they're server-distributed now).
  Still holds the `*HoldSets.json` files and other bundled assets.

## File naming conventions

The catalog resource base name (from `Board.catalogResource(angle:)`) is still the identity of a
board+angle "slab" — it's now the **cache filename** (`Application Support/CatalogCache/<name>.json`
on iOS) rather than a bundled resource:

- **Single-angle** (Mini 2025 only, 40°): `MiniMoonBoard2025Catalog` — no angle suffix.
- **Multi-angle**: `<Name>Catalog_<angle>`, e.g. `MoonBoardMasters2019Catalog_40`. `_25` and `_40`
  are the wall angle in degrees.
- **Hold sets** (still bundled): `<Name>HoldSets.json`, e.g. `MiniMoonBoard2025HoldSets.json`.

## JSON schemas

### Catalog file

```jsonc
{
  "setup": "Mini MoonBoard 2025",
  "holdsetup": 22,        // optional; the active hold-set id (Mini catalogs)
  "layoutId": 5,          // optional; present in catalog-data staging, dropped from bundled files
  "angle": 40,            // wall angle, degrees
  "source": "boardsesh (ws.boardsesh.com/graphql)",
  "count": 4889,
  "problems": [
    {
      "id": "fdac08b2-…",   // UUIDv5, globally unique per (board, angle) — the catalog_problems PK
      "name": "…",
      "grade": "6A+",        // Font grade
      "userGrade": null,     // ignored by the app
      "setter": "mb_…",
      "stars": 5,            // rating 0–5
      "repeats": 28,         // ascent count
      "isBenchmark": false,
      "method": null,        // foot rule: "No kickboard" / "Footless" / "Footless + kickboard", else null
      "holds": [ { "c": 2, "r": 12, "t": "end" }, { "c": 5, "r": 5, "t": "start" } ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Hold encoding inside `holds`: `c` = column 0–10 (A–K), `r` = row (1 = bottom), `t` = type. **boardsesh
collapses hand holds**, so imported types are effectively `start` / `right` / `end` only (this is
why "beta" mode in the app has nothing finer to show for catalog problems).

### HoldSets file

```jsonc
{
  "sets": [ { "id": 28, "name": "Hold Set F" }, { "id": 29, "name": "Original School Holds" } ],
  "membership": { "0-1": 30, "0-10": 29, "0-12": 28 }   // "col-row" → owning set id
}
```

- `"col-row"` keys: col 0–10, row 1 = bottom (matches [board-geometry.md](board-geometry.md)).
- A set with **zero** membership entries is "always-on" (feet/art) — rendered but not filterable.
  See [multi-board-model.md](multi-board-model.md) §"Hold-set membership".

## Regenerating / adding a board

```bash
# 1. Fetch problems into the catalog-data/ staging area.
#    Curation rule for the committed snapshots: "benchmark OR repeats >= 10" — pass BOTH
#    flags; fetch_boardsesh.py UNIONS them (the benchmark flag alone misses popular problems).
python3 scripts/fetch_boardsesh.py --layout 5 --angle 40 --benchmarks-only --min-ascents 10
#   other flags: --all  --delay 0.25  --out-dir <path>.  (--min-ascents is inclusive: 10 → >=10.)

# 1b. (Optional) instead of re-fetching, ADD `method` to existing snapshots by uuid without
#     reshaping them: python3 scripts/enrich_catalog_methods.py

# 2. BACK UP the current table first — the import upserts in place with no row history.
SUPABASE_URL=https://<ref>.supabase.co SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-role-key> \
  python3 scripts/backup_catalog_problems.py                # -> catalog_problems_backup_<ts>.json

# 3. Upload the staged JSON to Supabase (idempotent upsert on source_catalog_id).
#    Needs the SERVICE-ROLE key (bypasses RLS) — never ship it in a client.
SUPABASE_URL=… SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=… \
  python3 scripts/import_catalog.py --all                   # or --layout 5 --angle 40

# 3b. Reconcile: soft-delete rows no longer in staging (the upsert never removes any).
#     Dry-run first, then --apply.
SUPABASE_URL=… SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=… \
  python3 scripts/prune_catalog_orphans.py --all            # add --apply to write

# 4. Derive hold-set membership (needs Pillow: pip install Pillow)
python3 scripts/derive_holdset_membership.py                # scans its BOARDS list → *HoldSets.json (bundled)

# 5. (New board only) import board art
python3 scripts/import_board_images.py [--src /path/to/boardsesh]

# 6. Register the board in Swift: add to Board.all in MoonBoardLED/Board/Board.swift
#    (and a MoonBoardSetup in MoonBoardSetup.swift if geometry differs). Clients then sync the
#    board's slab from Supabase the first time it's added/opened — no rebuild needed to ship data.
```

`derive_holdset_membership.py` samples each hold-set overlay PNG's alpha channel (threshold ~60) to
decide which grid positions a set owns; that's why it needs the imported board art present first.

## Gotchas

- **`Catalog.swift` decodes with `JSONSerialization`, not `Codable`**, because Codable is far
  slower over thousands of problems in debug builds. The synced disk-cache slabs are written in the
  same on-disk shape the bundled files used, so this fast path is unchanged — keep it if you touch
  loading. `CatalogSyncManager` writes slabs to `Application Support/CatalogCache/` and merges
  deltas by `source_catalog_id`.
- **First open of a board needs network.** The catalog is no longer bundled, so a board's first
  add/open fetches its slab from Supabase (cached after that, incl. offline). A cold offline
  first-run — or a clone with `Supabase.xcconfig` unset — shows an empty catalog until one sync.
- **Benchmark detection is unreliable on boardsesh.** When both `--benchmarks-only` and
  `--min-ascents N` are passed, `fetch_boardsesh.py` **unions** the two result sets (deduped by
  uuid) because the benchmark flag misses popular problems. (See the recent commit history around
  benchmark overrides.)
- **Foot-rule `method` comes from boardsesh `characteristics`.** The fetch scripts map
  `method_no_kickboard` / `method_footless` / `method_footless_kickboard` → `"No kickboard"` /
  `"Footless"` / `"Footless + kickboard"` (else `null`). To add `method` to snapshots that were
  fetched before this without re-fetching (which would reshape the curated slabs), run
  `scripts/enrich_catalog_methods.py` — it pages boardsesh and adds `method` to existing problems
  **by uuid** (additive, idempotent), then re-import with `import_catalog.py`. The web/iOS filter
  offers a **fixed** label list (not slab-derived), so it shows regardless of the loaded data.
- **Mini 2025 (layout 7) spans setIds `28,29,30,31` on boardsesh, not just `28`.** boardsesh
  re-partitioned it; `setIds="28"` alone now returns only a ~181-problem slice of the full ~4,870.
  Both fetch scripts use the full `28,29,30,31`. If a board's live count ever collapses, probe
  adjacent setIds before assuming data was deleted.
- API returns may hit `429/502/503`; the fetch scripts have retry/`--delay` handling.
- Hold-id ↔ (col,row) conversion inside the scripts: `holdId = (row-1)*11 + col + 1`; reverse is
  `col = (holdId-1) % 11`, `row = (holdId-1)//11 + 1`.
- `catalog-data/` is staging (the input to `import_catalog.py`); **Supabase** is the catalog source
  of truth clients sync from. `MoonBoardLED/Resources/` no longer holds catalogs — only `*HoldSets.json`.

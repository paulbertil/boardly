// The shared `?problem` detail-drawer protocol, used by both CatalogScreen and the
// logbook. The open problem's id lives in `?problem` (history-integrated, so browser Back
// closes the drawer); the *pager domain* is a state snapshot captured at open time —
// CatalogScreen hands over a recents snapshot, the logbook a day-session — because the id
// in `?problem` can't name which list the drawer was opened from.
//
// This hook owns the subtle, easy-to-drift parts: the push-on-open history entry, the
// close branch (pop history when we pushed, else clear the param in place), and dropping
// the snapshot whenever the drawer closes. The route-specific `?problem` writes stay with
// the caller (their `navigate` is route-typed), passed in as the three callbacks below;
// the caller also owns resolving `openId` + `pagerStack` into the current problem, since
// each screen resolves against a different domain.

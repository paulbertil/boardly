// Pure derivation of the header filter-pill bar's *removable* pills from FilterState.
// The pinned toggles (Benchmark, Favorites) are NOT produced here — they are rendered
// separately by FilterPillBar (they toggle, they don't "remove"). Each descriptor carries
// the exact FilterState patch to apply on removal, so the component stays dumb: tap →
// onChange({ ...filters, ...patch }).
//
// Ordering and gating deliberately mirror activeFilterCount/applyFilters so a pill never
// appears for a filter the list isn't actually applying:
//   - status only when `statusReady` (signed in + ascents loaded) AND not in a session
//     (in a session applyFilters ignores `statusFilters`, using the per-member path).
// Grade is not here — it's the pinned "Grade" control (a dropdown slider), not a chip.

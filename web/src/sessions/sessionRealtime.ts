// Real-time nudge subscriber for the active collaboration session. Subscribes to the private
// `session:<id>` Broadcast channel and, on a co-member's send, debounce-refetches the
// cross-member projection via refreshMemberAscents(). The nudge is a content-free doorbell —
// the actual sent/tried sets still arrive only through session_member_ascents() (0007), so this
// module never trusts the payload as data (KTD-5).
//
// Load-bearing invariants:
//   • Push is ADDITIVE (R6). This layers on top of memberAscentsStore's pull model (activation /
//     foreground / manual refresh / 5-min max-age). If Realtime is unconfigured or the socket
//     drops, activation no-ops / receives nothing and behavior degrades to exactly today's pull.
//   • Private channel (KTD-4): the socket must carry the user JWT before the channel joins, so we
//     resolve the session and setAuth() BEFORE creating + subscribing the channel. A stale async
//     resolution that lands after a session switch is dropped by the currentSessionId guard.
//   • Bursts coalesce (R7): many nudges within NUDGE_DEBOUNCE_MS collapse to one refetch.
//   • Self-sends are skipped: our own send never changes the cross-member projection for us.
//   • Clean teardown (R8): switching sessions or deactivating removes the channel; no leak.

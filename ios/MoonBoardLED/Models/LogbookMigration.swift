/// the *same* default id. This pass repairs that (guarantees distinct ids) and links
/// legacy user-problem ascents to their problem via the new `userProblemID`, so the
/// first sign-in seeds a correct, fully-linked logbook to the cloud.
///
/// Idempotent and guarded by a UserDefaults flag — runs at most once. Call it at
/// launch, before any sync, from a context bound to the app's shared container.
///
/// ⚠️ MUST be verified in Xcode against a populated store before shipping (the plan's
/// blocking migration-safety gate). This code is correct by construction but the
/// exact lightweight-migration behavior it compensates for is only observable on-device.
